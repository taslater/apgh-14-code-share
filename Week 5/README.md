# Databases I guess? #

## C# is back ##

Not just arrays in C#!

`string[] names = new string[3];`

C# has the `List<T> Class` (System.Collections.Generic)

## Data Normalization ##

Organize the data into fields in your tables!

Unnormalized form, first normalized form, second normalized form...

UNF, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF are usually as much detail as we need.

Is our table full of repetition? How can we address that?

### Data Integrity ###

Less repeated data, fewer typos, correct it once, make sure it's always "Philadelphia" not "Philly"

Capture the relationships between the data

### Horizontal and Vertical Repetition ###
