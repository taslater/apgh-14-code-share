# Notes from Jean-Friday (SQL) #

## Jean's good plan ##

* build a plan
* build the skeleton
* plan the db (sketch sample data)
* create a db
* populate with sample data
* read from the db - show users / current user ?!!
* write a tweet as a user

## Jean's good programming tips ##

1. Start with a skeleton
1. Label things 'good'
1. When planning data (design), include samples
1. Work on data display before data creation so you can see what you're creating later
1. work with the tiniest part you can - fewer things to go wrong
1. when debugging, LOOK AT WHAT'S ACTUALLY THERE
1. use syntax highlighting for super cool syntax tips
