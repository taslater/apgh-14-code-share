# Ruby testing with `rspec` #

`rspec` needs `lib` and `spec` folders

`spec` is the testing stuff

`lib` is what we're testing

**Convention** over **configuration** (just put your stuff in the right folders, but it only works that way)

It's not configurable, but you don't have to make those choices. Just get started within the bounds of convention.

## keywords ##

* `describe`, `context`, `it`
* `expect(<value_being_tested>).to eql(<expected_value>)`
