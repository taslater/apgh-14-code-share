# Conditionals Exercise #

Let's use conditionals in Ruby (`if`, `elsif`, `else` `case`)!

We'll check for conditions on a user's string (`.includes?`, `.length`) and update our Garden Box exercise to ask user for just one plant.

## Prompt ##

Does their name contain a certain letter?​

Is their name more than 10 characters long?​

Can you make something more complex with what you have?​

Garden Boxes:​

Ask the user what they want to plant and only show that option
