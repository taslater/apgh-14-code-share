# Auto-Battler #

Create an auto-battler game.

In this game, you should create a character. This can consist of giving it a name. Or more, up to you. Mostly a name. Maybe a job? The character should be assigned some number of hp.

There should be a main menu, from this menu, the player should be able to:

1) Buy some gear
2) Go heal
3) Look for a fight

When buying gear, the player should be able to buy an item that gives them more damage when looking for a fight. (A sword, a stick, a book of insults, a biochemistry textbook in a sock) - This should cost money

When healing, the player should be charged money to put their health points up to the maximum level

When looking for a fight, the player should find a monster. The player and the monster should take turns doing damage to each other until one is out of health points. If the monster loses, the player gains some money. If the player loses, the game is over and they must make a new character. The player should not be given any options during the fight, they should just watch it happen and find out the results.
