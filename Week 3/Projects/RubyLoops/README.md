## Prompt ##

Can you write a loop that doesn't count by ones?​

What about one that loops backward?​

FizzBuzz:​

Print the numbers 1-100​

If the number is a multiple of 3, instead of the number, print “fizz”​

If the number is a multiple of 5, instead of the number, print “buzz”​

If the number is a multiple of both, print “fizzbuzz”​

Let's do fizzbuzz and make it work​

This is a test that is still regularly used in programming tests
