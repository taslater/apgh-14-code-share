# Braille (Night Writer) #

Convert user text into braille using the traditional 2x3 square of
dots and spaces for each letter (using a 0 for a dot and . for a space).

Each line of text you change will end up with 3 lines of text.

[Here](https://www.pharmabraille.com/pharmaceutical-braille/the-braille-alphabet) is the map of how to braille

Eventually we will do this with all of these bits, for now you don't
have to make tests or anything yet, just make it function

Type something for me to convert:
hello
Your braille version is:
0.0.0.0.0.
00.00.0..0
....0.0.0.
